# Example: Crab species identification

We will work with a data set about Leptograpsus crabs originally presented in

Campbell, N.A. and Mahon, R.J. (1974) A multivariate study of variation in two species of rock crab of genus Leptograpsus. Australian Journal of Zoology 22, 417â€“425.

They have also been discussed previously in

Venables, W. N. and Ripley, B. D. (2002) Modern Applied Statistics with S. Fourth edition. Springer.

There are two species of this crab; we will attempt to predict the species of a crab based on measurements of its physical dimensions. The data we are working with contains 5 morphological measurements on 200 crabs, 100 each of two species of Leptograpsus crabs collected at Fremantle, W. Australia.

The variables in this data set are as follows:

-   `sp`: species - "B" or "O" for blue or orange.
-   `sex`: the crab's sex
-   `FL`: frontal lobe size (mm).
-   `RW`: rear width (mm).
-   `CL`: carapace length (mm).
-   `CW`: carapace width (mm).
-   `BD`: body depth (mm).

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(MASS)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(caret)
set.seed(478)
crabs <- MASS::crabs[sample.int(nrow(crabs)), ]
crabs <- crabs %>% dplyr::select(-index)
```

#### Binary encoding of response variable

\textcolor{white}{1}

It is traditional in logistic regression to use an indicator variable for the response variable:

\begin{align*}
Y_i &= \begin{cases} 1 & \text{ if crab number $i$ is an orange crab} \\ 0 & \text{ otherwise (if a blue crab)} \end{cases}
\end{align*}

```{r}
crabs <- crabs %>%
  mutate(
    sp_01 = ifelse(sp == "O", 1, 0) # 1 if orange, 0 otherwise
  )
head(crabs)
dim(crabs)
```

### Plot of the data

```{r, fig.height=2.5}
ggplot(data = crabs, mapping = aes(x = FL, y = sp_01)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

### Train logistic regression model

-   Behind the scenes, `sp` is converted to 0/1 representation by the train function
-   By default, assignment is in alphabetic order, so "B" goes to 0 and "O" goes to 1.

```{r}
logistic_fit <- train(
  form   = sp ~ FL,
  data   = crabs,
  family = "binomial", # this is an argument to glm; response is 0 or 1, binomial
  method = "glm",      # method for fit; "generalized linear model"
  trControl = trainControl(method = "none")
)
```

### Print model summary (coefficient estimates and p-values for tests)

```{r}
summary(logistic_fit$finalModel)
```

\newpage

### Plot estimated class probability function

Note: code is essentially identical to what we used for KNN.

```{r, fig.height=2.5}
predict_logistic_probs <- function(x, sp) {
  f_hats <- predict(logistic_fit, newdata = data.frame(FL = x), type = "prob")
  f_hats[[sp]]
}
ggplot(data = crabs, mapping = aes(x = FL, y = sp_01)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_function(fun = predict_logistic_probs, args = list(sp = "O")) +
  ylim(0, 1) + 
  theme_bw()
```

### What's the interpretation of $\hat{\beta}_1$?

For an increase of 1mm in the size of the frontal lobe of a crab, we expect the log odds of the crab to be orange to increase by 0.29994.

For an increase of 1mm in the size of the frontal lobe of a crab, we expect the odds of the crab to be orange to increase by a factor of $exp(0.29994) = 1.3498$.

### What's the estimated probability that a crab with a frontal lobe size of 20 mm is an orange crab? Calculate by hand too.

```{r}
predict(logistic_fit, newdata = data.frame(FL = 20), type = "prob")
```

$$
\hat{Pr}(Y=1 | FL=20) = \frac{e^{-4.6728 + 0.2.9994\cdot20}}{1+ e^{-4.6728 + 0.29994\cdot20}} = 0.7902
$$

\vspace{3cm}

### What's the predicted species for a crab with a frontal lobe size of 20 mm?

```{r}
predict(logistic_fit, newdata = data.frame(FL = 20))
```

Orange, since the probability of being an orange crab $=0.7802 > 0.5$.

\newpage

Code suppressed, but here's a comparison to a KNN fit with K = 30 neighbors:

```{r, echo = FALSE,fig.height=3}
knn_fit <- train(
  form = sp ~ FL,
  data = crabs,
  method = "knn",
  preProcess = "scale",
  trControl = trainControl(method = "none"),
  tuneGrid = data.frame(k = 30)
)

predict_knn <- function(x, sp) {
  f_hats <- predict(knn_fit, newdata = data.frame(FL = x), type = "prob")
  f_hats[[sp]]
}

ggplot(data = crabs, mapping = aes(x = FL, y = sp_01)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_function(fun = predict_logistic_probs,
    args = list(sp = "O")) +
  stat_function(fun = predict_knn,
    args = list(sp = "O"), color = "orange") +
  ylim(0, 1) +
  theme_bw()
```
